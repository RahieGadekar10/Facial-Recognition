# Facial-Recognition
The Face Recognition system is used for One-Shot Facial Verification which takes an input image through a webcam and comapres it with a baseline image already stored in the system and in the output layer compares the two images using distance metrics and loss function and results in the output if the image is Verified or Unverified. For this Model we are making use of a Siamese Neural Network which consists of two separate neural networks for two input vectors to compute comparable output vectors.
